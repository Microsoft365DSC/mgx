    What a recorded benchmark result says about the run that produced it, in
    tests/benchmarks/common.ps1: the documented budget tiers, and the tenant and tree identity
    Write-BenchResult stamps on every entry.

    No tenant and no Graph session: Get-MgContext, the count call and the telemetry snapshot
    are redefined in the scope common.ps1 is dot-sourced into, which is where Write-BenchResult
    resolves them from, and every entry is written under $TestDrive.
